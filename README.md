Assignment
Implement a Stack data structure for any type using an array. Have at least 2 Unit tests to test your
expected output. The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.

Implement the following methods:

push(E item) - Pushes an item onto the top of this stack.

pop() - Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.

empty() - Tests if this stack is empty.

count() - The number of items on the stack

Sample Input: 

push(42)

push(66)

push(99)


Sample Output:

pop -> 99 

pop -> 66

pop -> 42
